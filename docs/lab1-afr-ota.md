# Lab 1: Amazon FreeRTOS OTA #

> Over-the-air (OTA) update is a very common way for delivering updates to devices. Amazon FreeRTOS supports OTA updates to allow product makers for deploying firmware updates to one or more devices in their fleet.

![p0_ota.png](../pics/lab1/p0_ota.png)

There are some components that involve in Amamzon FreeRTOS OTA updates:

* **OTA update manager service** creates AWS IoT jobs to notify devices for available updates when an OTA updates are created. OTA update manager also provides information of OTA updates.
* **OTA agent** runs on a device to publish requests to AWS IOT CORE and receives updates using HTTP or MQTT protocol when an update is available. It also checks the digital signature of downloaded files and installs firmware updates.
* **Amazon S3** is used to store OTA update files.
* **Certificate manager** is a service that helps to provision, manage, and deploy public and private certificates for using with AWS services

We will go through the following steps to finish Amazon FreeRTOS OTA demonstration  in this lab:

1. Enable OTA agent and install initial version of firmware on ESP32
1. Prepare signed new firmware image and create OTA updates using OTA update manager
1. Deploy and activate new firmware image on ESP32

## Prerequisite ##

## Enable OTA agent and install initial version firmware on ESP32 ##

1. OTA agent demonstration configuration
   * Open \<AmazonFreeRTOS>/vendors/espressif/boards/esp32/aws_demos/config_files/aws_demo_config.h
   * Comment out #define CONFIG_*_DEMO_ENABLED, and define **CONFIG_OTA_UPDATE_DEMO_ENABLED**

        ```c
        #define     CONFIG_OTA_UPDATE_DEMO_ENABLED
        ```

2. OTA protocol configuration
   * Open \<AmazonFreeRTOS>/vendors/espressif/boards/esp32/aws_demos/config_files/aws_ota_agent_config.h
   * Check the configuration of OTA protocols, we use **MQTT** as the default protocol

        ```c
        #define configENABLED_CONTROL_PROTOCOL      ( OTA_CONTROL_OVER_MQTT )

        #define configENABLED_DATA_PROTOCOLS        ( OTA_DATA_OVER_MQTT )

        #define configOTA_PRIMARY_DATA_PROTOCOL     ( OTA_DATA_OVER_MQTT )
        ```

   * *(Optional)* If you want to enable transfer data over **HTTP**

        ```c
        #define configENABLED_DATA_PROTOCOLS        ( OTA_DATA_OVER_HTTP )

        #define configOTA_PRIMARY_DATA_PROTOCOL     ( OTA_DATA_OVER_HTTPT )
        ```

        > Because of a limited amount of RAM of ESP32, we need to turn off BLE when enabling HTTP as an OTA data protocol

        Open \<AmazonFreeRTOS>/vendors/espressif/boards/esp32/aws_demos/config_files/aws_iot_network_config.h, and change enabled network to WIFI only

        ```c
        #define configENABLED_NETWORKS         (AWSIOT_NETWORK_TYPE_WIFI )
        ```

3. Code-signing certificate configuration
   > ESP32 support a self-signed **SHA-256 with ECDSA** code-signing certificate, we will use [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) to generate private key and certificate
   * In your working folder, create and edit cert_conf.txt. Replace YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS with your email address

        ```text
        [ req ]
        prompt             = no
        distinguished_name = my_dn

        [ my_dn ]
        commonName = YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS

        [ my_exts ]
        keyUsage         = digitalSignature
        extendedKeyUsage = codeSigning
        ```

   * Open git-bash

        ![p1_git_bash](../pics/lab1/p1_git-bash.png)

   * Create ECDSA code-signing private key

        ```bash
        cd YOUR_WORK_FOLDER
        openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -pkeyopt ec_param_enc:named_curve -outform PEM -out ecdsasigner.key
        ```

   * Create an ECDSA code-signing certificate

        ```bash
        openssl req -new -x509 -config cert_config.txt -extensions my_exts -nodes -days 365 -key ecdsasigner.key -out ecdsasigner.crt
        ```

   * Go to [AWS Certificate Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?p=cmr&cp=bn&ad=c), and click **Import a certificate**
  
        ![p2_acm1.png](../pics/lab1/p2_acm1.png)
        ![p3_acm2.png](../pics/lab1/p3_acm2.png)

   * Add self-signed certificate for OTA agent
     * Open \<AmazonFreeRTOS>/demos/include/aws_ota_codesigner_certificate.h, and paste certificate to it. It should be formatted in the following way, and please **replace YOUR_BASE64_CERTIFICATE_DATA with yours**

        ```c
        static const char signingcredentialSIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PEM[] = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
        "YOUR_BASE64_CERTIFICATE_DATA\n"
        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
        ```

4. Build, install, and run firmware on ESP32 as previous labs
        ![p4_old-afr.png](../pics/lab1/p4_old-afr.png)

## Create OTA update ##

1. Create new firmware image
    > The OTA agent included with Amazon FreeRTOS checks the version of any update and installs it only if it is more recent than the existing firmware version

   * Edit \<AmazonFreeRTOS>/demos/include/aws_application_version.h and increment the APP_VERSION_BUILD token value

        ```c
        #define APP_VERSION_BUILD    6
        ```

   * Rebuild the new firmware image, the new image is put in \<AmazonFreeRTOS>/out/aws_demos.bin

2. Create Amazon S3 bucket and upload the new image
   * Sign in to the Amazon [S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)
   * Select the bucket that you created in prerequisite, and choose upload icon to add your new aws_demos.bin image

3. Create an OTA update
   * Go to AWS IoT console to create a job
    ![p14_ota1.png](../pics/lab1/p14_ota1.png)
   * Choose **Create an Amazon FreeRTOS OTA update job**, and select your device name in **Things** tab
   * Create OTA update job. Choose **Next** after you fill all items
     * Create a code signing profile
     * Select the new firmware image in S3
     * Choose an IAM role for OTA jobs
     ![p16_ota3.png](../pics/lab1/p16_ota3.png)
     ![p15_ota2.png](../pics/lab1/p15_ota2.png)
   * Under Job type, choose **Your job will complete after deploying to the selected devices/groups (snapshot)**. Then you can enter an ID and description for your OTA update job, and choose **Create**

## Activate OTA update ##

1. Connect to ESP32, and you will see the OTA agent is downloading, verifying, testing the new firmware image
2. The new version is showed after the new firmware image is installed
![p17_new-afr.png](../pics/lab1/p17_new-afr.png)
